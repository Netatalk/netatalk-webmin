The current level of Netatalk 2 feature support:
* Starting and stopping afpd and all AppleTalk services
* Interactive editor of all config files
* UI for all of the AppleVolumes.default options
* UI for a subset of afpd.conf options
* Connected user management

Known limitations:
* Editing afpd.conf through the form will remove unsupported options
* When multiple shared volumes use the same path, there is confusion
